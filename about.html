                        Max Kim is an American author of children's picture and early reader books.
                        <i>The Pumpkin with a Crack in It</i> is his first book twice over, as he wrote the original
                        in the second grade when he was seven and wanted nothing but to be a writer.  Max spent the next 28 years largely ignoring
                        his childhood dream, instead focusing on a life in STEM.  He spent the better part of a decade working in biotech investing
                        and digital health finance before deciding to pick up the pen again.<br /><br />
                        Outside of writing, Max is a huge word and board game enthusiast.  He's gone as far as programming his own word puzzle game
                        <a class="orange" href="https://orderly-game.com/">Orderly</a>, and has competed in the World Series of Board Games.  He lives
                        in the San Francisco Bay Area with his amazing wife, adorable son, and derpy-cute pugwawa (with a little princess on the way).
